# Drone Tracking Simulation with Kalman and UFIR Filters 

This project is a Python-based software. It was desgined with 2 reasons.
1. Different solvers to find solutions to MLAT localization problems were implmented and compared.
2. Simulation was designed to evaluate the performance of Kalman Filter and UFIR (Uniform Finite Impulse Response) Filter in tracking drones. The simulation processes Multilateration (MLAT) measurements to test and compare the accuracy and robustness of these tracking algorithms.

To run the software, it is required to install Python and packages: matplotlib, numpy, scipy, geodesy, pymap3d, statistics, ctypes, pandas

To run comparison between different solvers, run python script rawDataMLATMEthods.py. To run simulation, run symulation.py
